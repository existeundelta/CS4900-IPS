CS4900-IPS
==========

CS49 WESTERN MICHIGAN SENIOR DESIGN

Current individual spikes that needs to be created:
1) Create a Canvas that will constantly draw the new position of the device
(for single test usage, could use arrow key/touch to emulate movement)

2) Create a dropdown menu that'll work for kitkat 4.X android
(I believe this has been completed by kelvin, if done, please update this readme)

3) Create a standalone program that could send and receive info from the server
(Any info is fine, just need to know the method, this means creating both the client and server)

once 1) & 2) is done,
4) create a GUI that is used to send message to server 
(ya know, those alert message mr kap wanted so much)

that's all for now~ discussion in FB later
